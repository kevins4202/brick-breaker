===================
=: Core Concepts :=
===================

- List the four core concepts, the features they implement, and why each feature
  is an appropriate use of the concept. Incorporate the feedback you got after
  submitting your proposal.

  1. 2D-Arrays

A 2-D Array will represent the bricks

  2. I/O

A file will be used to store the game state so the player can resume when they want to

  3. Inheritance and Subtyping

There will be different types of bricks and balls that will inheret bases classes, but the different types of balls
will have different properties such as damage.

  4. Collections or Maps

A Linked List will be used to store all of the balls in the game

===============================
=: File Structure Screenshot :=
===============================
- Include a screenshot of your project's file structure. This should include
  all of the files in your project, and the folders they are in. You can
  upload this screenshot in your homework submission to gradescope, named 
  "file_structure.png".

=========================
=: Your Implementation :=
=========================

- Provide an overview of each of the classes in your code, and what their
  function is in the overall game.


- Were there any significant stumbling blocks while you were implementing your
  game (related to your design, or otherwise)?


- Evaluate your design. Is there a good separation of functionality? How well is
  private state encapsulated? What would you refactor, if given the chance?



========================
=: External Resources :=
========================

- Cite any external resources (images, tutorials, etc.) that you may have used 
  while implementing your game.
